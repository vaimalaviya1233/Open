Implementation of Adblib of [@tananaev](https://github.com/tananaev/adblib)
&amp; [@cgutman](https://github.com/cgutman/AdbLib)
and also uses Apache binary

if you study it currently you will be able to use adblib easily
also fortunately i tried using Base64 class of java.util and android.util both does not work so i had to use Apache which was in
cgutman's [AdblibTest](https://github.com/cgutman/AdbLibTest) example and it works
